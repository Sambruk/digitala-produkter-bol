# API for Order and Delivery (of digital educational resources)

##  Background  
The taskforce "Beställning och Leverans" was given the assignment of developing a series of APIs that enables webshop and producers of digital educational resources to exchange data, and simplify the administration of licenses after the purchase of said licenses.


FYI: Some terms have the Swedish name in parenthesis and the file names of the sample files are still in Swedish. 

**[1. Order](#1-order)**: Used by the webshop to place an order with the producer for a specific customer.

**[2. Assignment](#2-assignment)**: After the purchase has been completed, the customer can use a license administration portal to perform an assignment. The admin portal can either be a part of the webshop or completely separate entity. To perform an assignment the license portal simply sends the information required from the license portal to the producer regarding who should be given access to which licenses.

**[3. Statistics](#3-statistics)**: A license portal can fetch data from the producers and present the customer with how many licenses that have been acquired and how many that are actually being used. The data includes information on when the licenses were purchased and when they expire.

**[4. Return](#4-return)**: Returns from the reseller's customers to the reseller. The licenses is stored in the reseller's digital warehouse that is provided by the supplier.

Samples files are available via GitHub together with the most up to date information.

During asynchronous  replies only order lines that have been updated should be sent. The status "Delivered" is final and can not be updated.

```javascript
{
	serviceProviderId: "",
	clientId: "",
	clientOrderNumber: "",

## Sample files

### Order 1.js
An order for 1 copy that will be delivered to a private consumer that wants delivery in august. A prerequisite is that the supplier can handle "fromDate". The supplier should notify the customer when the order is activated.

Order reply (Ordersvar 1.js) shows the order being processed, which means it is pending approval. Expected deliver date is set to 2020-08-15 as requested.

### Order 2.js
An order containing two products with 18 copies each where assignment will be done through a license management portal and that the licenses should be delivered immediately. The delivery to the license management system is outside the scope of this work.  

Orderreply (Ordersvar 2.js) shows that assignment is possible and can be done through the system.

For instance if there is a rule that says a license must be unassigned, the reseller can help their customer unassigned it and later retry the return.

# Dates

Should be formated according to ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) “2020-03-30”.

# Method and authentication

All calls are done with HTTP POST if nothing else is specified.

Authentication is primarily done through mutual TLS (e.g. using Skolfederation Moa when possible), but can also be done via tokens (RFC 7519) or API keys in the HTTP header.
